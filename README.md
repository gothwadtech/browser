- 🛡️ **Integrated Ad & Tracker Protection:** Fast, real-time filter-list ad blocking (Brave `AdBlockClient` engine) directly intercepting network resources asynchronously without degrading render performance.
- 🗂️ **Advanced Tab Architecture:** Dynamic top-tab bar and row/grid tab switchers with proactive LRU memory trimming so you can keep 10+ tabs without background crashes.
- 🔒 **App Lock & Privacy:** Built-in PIN security lock to safeguard your browsing sessions, private files, notes, and history.
- 🌐 **Global Accessibility:** Native localized interfaces across 10+ languages with responsive 10-foot TV UI ergonomics.

## 🎮 Complete Input & Hardware Parity

Browsing on Android TV is often plagued by clunky remote controls or broken mouse input. Gothwad Browser is engineered with a **triple-input pipeline** where every input mechanism functions at full fidelity without interfering with another:

| Input Method | Supported Behaviors & Capabilities |
|---|---|
| **TV Remote / D-Pad** | Smooth on-screen virtual cursor with proportional acceleration, intelligent directional focus navigation across headers, tabs, and web elements. |
| **Physical USB / Bluetooth Mouse** | Native Chromium mouse events (`SOURCE_MOUSE`), pixel-accurate hover states, right-click contextual menus, native click-drag blue text selection, and fluid scroll-wheel physics. |
| **Physical Keyboard** | Full hardware shortcut suite (`Ctrl+T` new tab, `Ctrl+W` close tab, `Ctrl+Tab` switch tabs, `Ctrl+R` refresh, etc.) with pure-modifier release protection. |
| **Touchscreen (Tablets & Phones)** | Multi-touch gestures, fluid pinch-to-zoom (GPU-accelerated), and responsive edge-to-edge touch layouts. |

---

## 🧰 Integrated Productivity Suite

Gothwad Browser eliminates the need to switch between multiple utility apps on your TV:

1. **📁 Inbuilt File Manager:**
   - Explore local TV storage, external USB drives, and download directories directly from the browser sidebar.
   - Quick preview, file deletion, and direct APK/media launching on large screens.
2. **📝 TV Notepad & Notes:**
   - Jot down quick thoughts, recipes, URLs, streaming links, or cheat codes while browsing.
   - Accessible at any time via the quick-action sidebar without losing your current web tab.
3. **📋 Smart Clipboard Manager:**
   - Automatically captures copied text and links from web pages.
   - Quick-access snippets and history with duplicate suppression and incognito-mode safety.
4. **📥 Robust Downloads Manager:**
   - Dedicated download orchestrator with background service persistence (`BrowserKeepAliveService`) preventing the TV OS from killing long downloads.

## 🚀 Genesis & Engineering Journey

Gothwad Browser was born out of frustration with existing TV browsers that were either sluggish, filled with intrusive ads, or incapable of handling basic mouse and keyboard inputs.

```

- **The AI Studio Foundation:** The initial architecture was scaffolded in **Google AI Studio** during the first two weeks, quickly validating the tab management, input routing, and core UI abstractions.
- **The Shift to Antigravity & Android Studio:** Development was transitioned to **Antigravity** and local **Android Studio** for deep native optimization. Over 60% of the codebase was developed through precision AI-augmented engineering, coupled with rigorous human systems programming.
- **Battle-Tested Across 100+ Real Devices:** Before its first public release, Gothwad Browser underwent over a month of stress testing on emulators and **100+ physical hardware configurations**—including low-end Amlogic, Allwinner, and Rockchip TV boxes, certified Google TV dongles, Fire OS streaming devices, and Android tablets.
- **The Golden Engineering Rule:** **"Zero Jugaad — Native Platform First."** Every workaround (synthetic touch conversion, CSS zoom hacks, forced algorithmic dark mode) was eradicated in favor of clean, native Android and Chromium APIs.
- **The Grand Vision:** An all-in-one, productive, feature-dense web browser that never compromises on performance and stays strictly **under 10 MB**.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Philosophy

```
app/src/main/java/
 ├── webengine/              # Chromium WebView encapsulation & lifecycle
 │    ├── WebViewEx.kt       # Native event dispatch, zoom, desktop mode
 │    └── WebViewClients.kt  # onRenderProcessGone crash resilience & page hooks
 ├── activity/main/          # Core TV & Mobile UI Activities & Sidebars
 │    ├── TabsModel.kt       # LRU memory management & proactive tab trimming
 │    └── MainActivityDpad.kt# TV remote focus-routing & shortcut mapping
 ├── widgets/cursor/         # Precision virtual D-Pad cursor overlay
 ├── notes/                  # Inbuilt TV Notepad & Room database
 ├── clipboard/              # Clipboard Manager with feedback-loop guarding
 └── service/keepalive/      # Foreground keep-alive service for TV multitasking
```

- **Clean MVVM + Clean Architecture:** High cohesion, low coupling, and zero blocking calls on the UI or WebView threads.
- **Crash Immunity:** Full recovery via `onRenderProcessGone`—if a heavy JavaScript/WASM tab crashes the renderer, the foreground tab is safely reloaded while background tabs are silently trimmed.
- **Memory Bounded:** Proactive LRU tab unloading keeps memory usage within safe thresholds, even on 1GB RAM TV boxes.
